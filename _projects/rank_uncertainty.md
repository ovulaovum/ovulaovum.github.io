In this paper, we propose a general framework to deal with decision-making problems wherein uncertainty occurs in a rank aggregation process. A novel solution approach for the integrated problem is proposed via robust optimization and an efficient algorithm is designed based on constraint generation for tractable computation. By investigating the statistical properties of our problem, we are able to derive theoretical guarantees for the likelihood of the true rank, which in turn helps to quantify the uncertainty set for the robust optimization problem. We illustrate applications of our framework using examples in advertising revenue management and supply chain design problems.
