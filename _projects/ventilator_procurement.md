Motivated by the procurement auctions of COVID-19 critical medical resources, we examine the United States federal government’s dual roles as both principal and agent in such auctions. We propose a resource allocation mechanism called Optimal Resource Allocation under Second-price Auction (ORASP), which consists of a first-stage second-price auction and a second-stage market game. In the first-stage auction of an indivisible bundle of items, we examine how the surplus is distributed when collusion behaviors are allowed. A nested knockout mechanism is proposed at this stage, which turns out to achieve the Shapley value. In the second stage, items are traded in a market game and the core of the two-stage game is studied. Since the federal government has an information advantage about players’ valuation, our analysis shows that a dual-roled federal government may bid untruthfully to raise the market price, reducing the aggregate utility. Numerical examples are provided using ventilator procurement data in the United States. We show that the proposed two-stage mechanism can outperform popular models such as second-price auctions, centralized allocation, and dynamic auctions in terms of collective payoff (the aggregate utility). Beyond the COVID-19 contexts, our results caution against dual roles in procurement auctions and provide policy guidelines in such pandemics response/management.
